Project Summary: Analysis of House Price Influences
Project Overview
This project investigates how independent variables—price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size—affect the price of a high-floor, spacious 2-bedroom house with a spectacular view, available at an affordable price.

Methodology
Data Source:

Used the Data.xlsx file for analysis.
Hypotheses Tested:

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant effect of the independent variables (price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size) on the house price.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant effect of the independent variables on the house price.
Confidence Level:

A 95% confidence level was selected, which means the confidence interval covers 95% of the normal distribution curve, allowing for a 5% probability of observing a value outside this range.
Statistical Test:

Performed a multiple regression analysis to examine the relationship between the dependent variable (price) and the independent variables (price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size).
Key Findings
The multiple regression analysis results, including coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals, indicate the extent to which each independent variable affects the house price.
The analysis helped determine whether to reject the null hypothesis based on the significance levels of the independent variables.
Documentation
Detailed results from the regression analysis have been documented, including relevant plots and tables, to illustrate the impact of the independent variables on house prices.
